The coronavirus pandemic continues to test humanitarian responses in 2021, while the world faces new questions about how to ensure equal access to vaccines. Many countries have started rolling out coronavirus vaccines, but it’s unclear when – and in some cases, how – these vaccines will reach people caught in crisis zones. The COVID-19 pandemic is driving record-breaking humanitarian needs: Global aid response plans total more than $35 billion this year. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--

//--><!]]> Beyond the immediate humanitarian impacts, the cost of helping the world's most vulnerable 10 percent facing COVID-19's socio-economic repercussions could total $90 billion, according to UN estimates. The World Bank estimates the pandemic pushed between 119 million and 124 million “new poor” into extreme poverty last year – a shift unlikely to be reversed in 2021. There’s a clear divide in who has early access to coronavirus vaccines. Public health officials warn of “vaccine nationalism”, hoarding, and queue-jumping as wealthier countries buy up early supplies. “The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure – and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries,” said the World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. As of 3 February, three quarters of all global doses were in only 10 countries, and more than 94 percent of countries beginning vaccinations were high-income or upper-middle-income. The WHO has inked agreements to reserve some 1.3 billion doses for 92 low- and middle-income countries under the COVAX programme, which was created with the goal of ensuring equal vaccine access, including doses for at least 20 percent of countries’ populations. But Tedros said wealthier countries are circumventing COVAX by signing dozens of bilateral deals with manufacturers – driving up prices and potentially delaying COVAX deliveries. He urged countries to vaccinate health workers and older people, then share excess doses with COVAX. Countries will receive their first COVAX doses in late February or early March, the WHO and other agencies behind the scheme announced on 3 February. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, the Philippines, Rwanda, and South Africa will be among the first handful to receive vaccines through the programme. Current planning calls for some 330 million doses – enough to cover 3.3 percent of participating countries’ populations – in the first half of 2021. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--

//--><!]]> Beyond vaccine access at the country level, there are fears that marginalised groups often left out of government health planning at the best of times – migrants, refugees, and other people in crises, for example – may be at the very back of the queue. “Those living in humanitarian emergencies or in settings that are not under the control of national governments are at risk of being left behind and must be part of COVID-19 vaccination efforts,” warned the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, an umbrella group for humanitarian responders. The COVAX programme includes plans for a “humanitarian buffer”, which would see five percent of the total doses stockpiled for “acute outbreaks” or for use by humanitarian groups. Potential uses could include vaccinating “refugees who may not otherwise have access”, according to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. - Refugees and migrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be given access to a COVID-19 vaccine “once it is available”, said the UN’s migration agency, IOM, warning of outbreak risks in overcrowded shelters. - South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said COVID-19 vaccines will be available to all, “regardless of their citizenship or residence status”, after the country received its first doses on 1 February. But Human Rights Watch said there were conflicting statements from the country’s health minister. - Eswatini, Malawi, and Mozambique are struggling with a new COVID-19 strain, but haven’t received a single vaccine dose, Médecins Sans Frontières said on 3 February. “We are appalled by the inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across the world,” said MSF’s Christine Jamet, adding that it was “indefensible” if lower-risk citizens in wealthier countries are vaccinated while frontline health workers elsewhere are forced to wait. - There is “no guaranteed channel” to get vaccines to some two million people living in rebel-controlled parts of northeast Syria, Human Rights Watch warned on 2 February. Syria is set to receive one million doses by mid-year through COVAX, but HRW said government planning is unlikely to include the northeast. - Afghanistan is relying on donors to fund the bulk of its vaccine purchases, and on aid groups to help roll out eventual vaccination programmes. Vaccines (and funding) for the first 20 percent of the population will come through the COVAX Advanced Market Commitment programme, which is meant to ensure supplies for low-income countries. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are covering funds for another 40 percent. The WHO and UNICEF are working with the government on a national vaccine deployment plan, including measures to solidify the supply chain and train health workers. Other UN agencies and NGOs will make vaccine rollout a part of new and existing programmes, the UN says. - India’s vaccine diplomacy began with a hashtag and cargo flights carrying hundreds of thousands of doses bound for neighbouring countries. India started vaccine shipments to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Seychelles on 20 January. India has also offered doses to Afghanistan, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka. Absent from this list: India’s rival, Pakistan, which later announced it would receive 500,000 vaccine doses from China. The so-called “vaccine maitri”, or “vaccine friendship”, campaign began as India continues the daunting task of vaccinating its own 1.3 billion citizens. - Jordan was one of the world’s first countries to begin coronavirus vaccinations for refugees, according to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR. Jordan’s vaccination programme, which started mid-January, is open to anyone living in the country, including refugees and asylum seekers. Of 90 countries developing national vaccination strategies, 51 explicitly include refugees, UNHCR said. - Lebanon has inked a deal with the World Bank to fund vaccines for two million people. Health officials have said Palestinian refugees “and all the other residents on Lebanese territory” will be included in vaccination planning, but Human Rights Watch said there have been mixed signals, and it’s unclear whether UN agencies would be expected to handle these vaccinations. - Rights groups are urging Israel to provide vaccines to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. As of 3 February, Israel had provided at least one dose for more than a third of its citizens. But the country’s health minister said responsibility for vaccinating Palestinians in the occupied territories lies with the Palestinian Authority. - Denying vaccines to Venezuelan refugees in Colombia could fuel conflict, aid group Mercy Corps warned, after Colombian leader Iván Duque announced that undocumented Venezuelans would not receive free doses.
